## Notes for Further Development

This is a simple demonstration project. In a real-world e-commerce site, you would need to:

1. Connect to a backend for product data and user authentication
2. Implement a real payment processing system
3. Add server-side form processing for the contact form
4. Add user accounts and order history
5. Implement proper security measures
